  - Tyler: Communication between designers and programmers
- What do we not like:
  - Allen: Having to do the assignment at the last day when it's due
  - Shota: Did not define roles within the team (for some people)
  - Vincent: Would've been better to start programming earlier when the design just finished to talk about what is possible & not possible within the time constraints
  - Jonathan: Could've started programming a bit earlier
  - Anny: Programmers not taking a part in the designing since they don't have clue about how the app is going to look like before they start coding
  - Audrey: Programmers not participating in the design (mainly due to time constraint)
  - Ethan: Not having enough involvement (as a designer) in the programming
  - Andrew: Use JavaScript before sufficient knowledge has been built from the Lab 4
  - Mitchell: Roles not being more specific in the sub-teams (frontend v.s. backend)
  - Tyler: Designers not having enough involvement in the project after completing the designing work
