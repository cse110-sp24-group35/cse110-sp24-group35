# PNPM

## Context and Problem Statement
`npm` creates a lot of unnecessary files due to its inability to reuse dependencies. There is a clear alternative that improves the developer experience without making any code-level changes.

## Decision Drivers
* Insert "`node_modules` is deeper than the entire universe" meme here

## Considered Options
* Yarn
* PNPM

## Decision Outcome
* Use `pnpm` to install dependencies instead of `npm`. This also applies to CI and CD runners' environment.
