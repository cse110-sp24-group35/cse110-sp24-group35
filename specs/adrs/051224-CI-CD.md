# Testing

## Context and Problem Statement
CI/CD is important in a relatively large project. What should we include in the CI/CD pipelines to make it easy but efficient?

## Decision Drivers
* Automation is important

## Considered Options
* GitHub Actions
* ESLint
* HTMLHint
* Stylelint
* `wearerequired/lint-action`

## Decision Outcome
* Use Github Actions for CI and CD
* Pipeline
  * Run linter on the codebase, reject if style is not being followed
  * Run code vulnerability check with CodeQL
  * Run code quality check with CodeClimate
  * Run unit tests with Mocha & Chai
  * Run code coverage with nyc and codecov
  * Run E2E tests with Puppeteer and Mocha & Chai
  * Run deployment to deploy our application to Github Pages
  * Generate documentation from JSDocs
