# Babel

## Context and Problem Statement
CSE 110 has very tight library and framework constraints. Babel was deemed as a transpiler that's explicitly not allowed in the scope of final project. However, no library or tool is known to properly implement test coverage with ESM (the syntax that browser uses) instead of CJS (Node.js syntax).

## Decision Drivers
* Test coverage is a very important aspect in code quality, vulnerability, and stability measurement. It is very important to have this implemented. 
* Test coverage libraries don't have full ESM support.

## Considered Options
* Node.js native test runner
* C8
* nyc
* Jest built in istanbul integration

## Decision Outcome
* Use Babel to transpile code from ESM to CJS for the purpose of testing **only**
* Negotiated with professor and he granted approval for Babel usage.
