# Priorities

## Context and Problem Statement
We only have ~4 weeks left until the project is due. What should we prioritize to get the most satisfiable deliverable done?

## Decision Drivers
* Grading emphasizes CI/CD pipelines, device compatibility, and accessibility (e.g. local first)
* Less complexity and smaller workload

## Considered Options
* Overview, Calendar, Journal, and sentiment widget
* Overview, Calendar, Journal
* Overview, Calendar, Kanban, Journal
* Overview, Kanban Journal

## Decision Outcome
* Complete Overview first, then Journal, then Calendar, then Kanban, then sentiment widget.
* If time runs out before we get to the next stage, simply discard the feature.
